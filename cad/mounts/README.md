Flex Mounts are very versatile. Here are some tips on how to print them:

1. Print flex mounts with a flexible matrial like TPU. We tried [SainSmart Black TPU](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-Flexible-Printing-Filament-Dimensional/dp/B00TI3JUTM/) and it was easy to print with, and we were happy with the print quality.
2. Our flex mounts are multi part designs, so that you can mix and match materials. Import them as multipart print into your slicer, and they should align themselves properly.
